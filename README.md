As part of a comprehensive data science project, I focused on building simple linear regression models to address two distinct problem statements. The project involved leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), data transformations, and model selection techniques to construct predictive models using Python. Here's a brief overview of the project:
 
Problem Statements:
 
Salary Hike Prediction:
 The objective of the project was to construct a predictive model for salary hike using simple linear regression. By exploring the relationship between salary hike and relevant factors, I endeavored to develop a model capable of forecasting salary hikes based on input parameters.
 
 - Dataset: Salary_Data.csv

Delivery Time Prediction:
 The project aimed to predict delivery time based on sorting time, utilizing a simple linear regression approach. By analyzing the relationship between delivery time and sorting time through EDA, I sought to build a predictive model that accurately estimates delivery time given the sorting time as input.
 
 - Dataset: delivery_time.csv
 
Approach:
 
The project followed a structured methodology involving several key steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and selection. Using Python programming language and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, I performed data manipulation, visualization, and model building tasks.
 
For each problem statement, I began by exploring the datasets to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and assess correlations between features. I then conducted necessary transformations such as feature scaling or encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for model training. Subsequently, I split the datasets into training and testing sets to train the simple linear regression models.
 
During model training, I utilized the least squares method to estimate the coefficients of the linear regression models and evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared. Through iterative experimentation, I fine-tuned the models and selected the best-performing one based on its predictive accuracy and generalization ability.
 
The project not only provided valuable insights into the predictive modeling process but also enhanced my proficiency in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques, underscoring the significance of simple linear regression in predictive analytics and decision-making.
